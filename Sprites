All the sprites will be kept under this directory.
However, I doubt any other sprites than the arrow will be used,
and in all honesty, in the future I might draw the vertices of the arrow manually with linear algebra.
Doing so would remove all dependancies for external files in the project.

But for now, the Sprites folder needs to be under the same directory as the sourcecode.
